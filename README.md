# Incident-Response-Stuff
Random collection of scripts that have served me well at one time or another, Macmemdump.sh / winmemdump.ps1 both automate the

Smurfinder.ps1 has a bunch of modules to automate AD lookups and some integrations with SCCM 
[Disclaimer] You will have to fill in some of the SCCM information within the script to work with your companies SCCM instance.
